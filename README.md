A pizza restaurant website where everything is dynamically rendered using DOM manipulation and is fully responsive.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

The HTML file contains only a single div which holds all the contents of each page. Everything is dynamically created with JavaScript using ES6 Modules and is bundled with Webpack. Every page is separated into different modules and components shared between each page have their module as well. Switching to another tab of the website clears out the single div’s content and renders that tab’s content.

## Optimizations:

In the future, I would like to recreate this website using React and improve the overall design of the website.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to work with ES6 Modules and Webpack which helped reduce the amount of HTML I had to write. I can see the use case for using ES6 Modules since it allows you to have reusable code. I was able to reuse the header and footer modules on every single page.
